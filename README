Hi! This is a model dependent equity statistical arbitrage backtest module for Python. Roughly speaking, the input is a universe of N stock prices over a selected time period, and the output is a mean reverting portfolio which can be used for trading. 

Please see a more complete introduction in the IPython Notebook file "PyArb Intro.ipynb". If you don't have IPython installed and/or want to just see the results, you can instead view the corresponding HTML version "PyArb Intro.html". Please note that just clicking the file in GitHub opens the raw version, so instead click the following link to see the actual notebook:

Since this is only a backtest module, I've decided to do a "walk-forward" with the optimized parameters from this backtest. In practice this would be just another backtest but the rules are that the parameters cannot be changed to make sure there's no data snooping. Feel free to check out the progress at my homepage at http://www.heikkiarponen.net

If you have any questions, drop me an email at heikki.a.arponen@gmail.com.
